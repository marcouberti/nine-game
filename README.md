9X Game
===================

9X is an endless **board game** where you have to merge cells together through swiping and rotating them and try to get the highest score as possible before no more moves are possible.

This is a **native Android project** written 100% in **Kotlin**, it uses *LiveData*, *ViewModels*, *ConstraintSet animations*.
